/**
 * Structured I/O classes: A structured I/O driver is usually a singleton
 * which can load or store data to and from streams, potentially in the
 * form of text. These drivers provide a lot of default methods and
 * delegates for different kinds of streams, which makes it easier to use
 * them.
